## Why?

Be a free simple card collection tracker with an import/export feature. 

Every app on the market:

- doesnt have a desktop web version
- has awful UI
- no free edition or even a free trial
- adding cards is way too complicated
- NO DATA EXPORT
- Too focused on price and investing

This app may add price features eventually but there are 20 apps on the Play Store that do this well already. 

## Roadmap

**Eventually**
- limitless tcg-like searches ie -has:rule_box
- checkboxes to filter for GLC, expanded, and other formats
- card variant tracking (reverse holofoil, holofoil, etc)
- add a loading throbber to the initial page load which can be slow
- import button
- Various UI improvements
- feedback button
- Export data to google drive
- folders/collections
- deckbuilder
- card scanner
- virtual scrollnig

**MAYBE**
- price tracking
- mobile app
- premium paid service for scanning past a free limit/day
