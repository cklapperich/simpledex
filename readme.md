## Why?

Be a free simple card collection tracker with an import/export feature. 

Every app on the market:

- doesnt have a desktop web version
- has awful UI
- no free edition or even a free trial
- adding cards is way too complicated
- NO DATA EXPORT
- Too focused on price and investing

This app may add price features eventually but there are 20 apps on the Play Store that do this well already. 

## Roadmap

**Eventually**
- limitless tcg-like searches ie -has:rule_box
- checkboxes to filter for GLC, expanded, and other formats
- card variant tracking (reverse holofoil, holofoil, etc)
- add a loading throbber to the initial page load which can be slow
- import button
- Various UI improvements
- feedback button
- Export data to google drive
- folders/collections
- deckbuilder
- virtual scrolling for card lists
- option for list-form for collections and decks that dont show images
- make the google login a modal/popup
- figure out why initial page load is so slow
- better mobile UI, sidebar moves to top, cards autosize to fit 2 cards wide in vertical mode. Make UI elements flow/stack automatically
    - when tilted horizontally on mobile, sidebar goes back to side.
- 'share your collection' feature
- if you click on 'signed out' it should signed you in. And the signin/signout should move to the bottom of the sidebar, too easy to click?

**MAYBE**
- price tracking
- mobile app
- card scanner
- premium paid service for scanning past a free limit/day
